        <div class="intro">Hello my name is Matthew Jensen. I am from a small town called Arco Idaho. There I helped
            my grandparents farm and ranch. I loved it and it became a major part in my life. After a while
            I realized there was a problem. Everyone talked about going to cattle auctions, but I never went
            to one. So finally I managed to convince my parents to let me go so I can experience the amazing
            cattle acutions that everyone loved. It was an amazing experience until the actual auction part 
            happened. 
              I had a super hard time following along with all the information the auctioneer was 
            saying. So then an idea popped in my head. I can create a website that helps the people who 
            have a hard time at auctions. Thus Jensen auctions was born. I began researching about the best
            ways to create a website. I also got real peoples advice about how to format the website so it 
            was easier to use. For my education I am attending BYU-I. Here I am studying for a computer 
            degree. I am determined to learn multiple coding languages. So far I have done HTML and python 
            but I plan on learning more in the future.
