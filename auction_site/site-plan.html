      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>My purpose for this site is to create an auction website for cattle auctions. I want it 
        to be display cattle numbers, the farmers information, cattle information, and the price.
      </p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>My intended audience is mostly for older people. Auctions can be loud and very confusing 
        so this webpage will help them be able to get all the information they need so they can have
        a better time at the auction.

      <h3>Cattle information</h3>
      <p>
        Here is all of the infomation about any and all farmers that are selling cattle. Here we have 
        the farmers information. We provide the phone number state where they came from, and anything 
        else that is relative to selling any cattle. 
          We will also have the herd information. This Page
        will show the amount of cows being sold. It will also provide the average herd weight, what they
        have been eating, and any other important information. We will also note any genetic defects 
        found in the cattle, any recent sickness, or anything else that may be of concern to a farmer 
        that wants to buy the cattle and introduce it to the herd. 
        Amongst this information we will 
        provide the auction information. This will consist of there place in line when they will be sold,
        there auction tags, and any other information that will help identify them so they can easily be
        spotted.

      <h3>About Us</h3>
      <p>
        Hello my name is Matthew Jensen. I am from a small town called Arco Idaho. There I helped
        my grandparents farm and ranch. I loved it and it became a major part in my life. After a while
        I realized there was a problem. Everyone talked about going to cattle auctions, but I never went
        to one. So finally I managed to convince my parents to let me go so I can experience the amazing
        cattle acutions that everyone loved. It was an amazing experience until the actual auction part 
        happened. 
          I had a super hard time following along with all the information the auctioneer was 
        saying. So then an idea popped in my head. I can create a website that helps the people who 
        have a hard time at auctions. Thus Jensen auctions was born. I began researching about the best
        ways to create a website. I also got real peoples advice about how to format the website so it 
        was easier to use. For my education I am attending BYU-I. Here I am studying for a computer 
        degree. I am determined to learn multiple coding languages. So far I have done HTML and python 
        but I plan on learning more in the future.
